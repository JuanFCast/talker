# **Performance Report: HelloWorld-ICE**

Hello everyone! I'd like to share some insights into the performance metrics we've derived from our `HelloWorld-ICE` system. Understanding these metrics is crucial for gauging how our system behaves under specific load conditions.

## **Metrics Analyzed:**

---

### üöÄ **Throughput**

- **Description:** Represents the number of requests the system can handle within a second.
- **Calculation:** It's determined by dividing the total number of requests by the total time taken to process them.
- **Result:** 621.1180124223603 requests per second.

---

### ‚è± **Response Time**

- **Description:** Indicates the time the system takes to respond to a single request.
- **Calculation:** Measured from the moment a request is sent until a response is received.
- **Result:** 7ms.

---

### ‚ùå **Missing Rate**

- **Description:** Illustrates how many requests were missed or not acknowledged by the system.
- **Calculation:** Determined by dividing the number of requests that didn't receive a response by the total number of requests sent.
- **Result:** 0.0 (indicating no requests were missed).

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è **Unprocessed Rate**

- **Description:** Refers to how many requests the system received but couldn't process.
- **Calculation:** Compares the number of received events to the number of processed ones. The difference between them, divided by the total received events, gives the rate.
- **Result:** 0.0 (indicating all requests were processed adequately).

Performance is key in ensuring our system operates optimally. Transparency in how these metrics are calculated is crucial for confidence in the results. We'll continue working on optimizations and improvements based on this data. Thank you for your attention!
